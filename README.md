## Case Study: Recycling in the 21st Century

**Alex:** “We have Alexa, a Roomba, connected thermostats and even a networked stove (no idea why). But I still have to sort my trash?!?”

**Blair:** “”

**Cory:** “”

## This is a typical Maker-product

There is a huge community of "Makers" that build stuff, just because they can. Check out Youtube videos from [Mark Rober](https://www.youtube.com/@MarkRober) to understand what I mean.

While makers usually don't worry too much about "best practices" regarding development, doesn't change the fact that we can follow them, even thos STC is a typical maker product.

This is the medium size case study from [Product Velocity](https://www.productvelocity.org). We include it so that

1. We can see the evolution of a project that is small enough to unfold in a few weeks, but still has all the typical challenges of combining mechanical, electrical and software elements.
2. That is fit for a semester-long college or university class.
